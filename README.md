# Twitter Web View
Some people may prefer using Twitter from the Web App instead of the official App. This App displays Twitter as if you were using your Browser, but in it's own App.

Not affiliated with Twitter.

## Notifications
This App does NOT support Push Notifications. If you want to recieve Notifications, I'd recommend either signing up for sms/email Notifications, get them from your Browser, or also having the Official Twitter App.

## Installation
This App is not available in the Google Play store, so to install the App, you need to download the .apk file from this site, find it in your files, and then tap the .apk file. Your phone may not like you downloading Apps from the internet, but you can safely ignore the warnings and press "Install Anyways".
